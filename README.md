# Introduction

Starter.js is a feature rich micro SaaS starter kit intended to shorten the amount of time it takes to build and ship micro SaaS applications for founders and tech enthusiasts. The average time it takes to ship a SaaS application nowadays is roughly 30-70 days on average. There are other projects set out to considerably shorten this time and make the developer experience much more convienient. However they cost alot of money. And one thing that a SaaS founder is sure is that his/her app might not take off soon and there will be no refunds for what they pay for.

Luckily here is where we come in. This project is initiated by founders who themselves suffeded from this experience of wanting to ship faster but slowed by unesseccary non-business logic related jurgons such as handling auth, landing page, payment integrations, components, DB configurations, Testing, Deployment and much much more. We provide all the features that the paid starter kits provide minus the upfornt cost. 

## Features

This starter kit is built considering scalablity, SEO, maintainablity, automated testing and deployment, esthetics and elegance. Our supported features include the following:

âœ” CLI tool for scafolding, generating and building

âœ” Tailwind css and shadcn + next UI support
